    <p>IlTuboDeiTutorials is a YouTube channel where i started posting tutorials to help people. I'm an italian guy that lives in Italy, Campania. I started this project in 2018, but i just posted a few vidoes, and i never started posting constantly. In the meanwhile i also started coding, and i made this website as an exercise, but it could also became a real thing in the future.</p>

        <h2>Do you have any profit purpose?</h2>
        <p>No, i don't, everything is free and all my creations are OpenSource. I made all of this just to learn and have fun, that's why it's all free, but that's also why i don't post constantly, and don't keep all my creations and tutorials up to date. Maybe in the future all of this can become a real thing with a profit purpose, but, at the moment, no.</p>
