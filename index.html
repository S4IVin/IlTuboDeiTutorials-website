    <p>IlTuboDeiTutorials is a YouTube channel where i started posting tutorials to help people. I'm an italian guy that lives in Italy, Campania. I started this project in 2018, but i just posted a few vidoes, and i never started posting constantly. In the meanwhile i also started coding, and i made this website as an exercise, but it could also became a real thing in the future.</p>
